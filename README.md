# COM-421-Website

This is a website for my COM 421 class. It uses only HTML and CSS.

## Walkthrough

- The first page is the [home page](https://lehuman.github.io/COM-421-Website/html/home.html), this is where I put a picture of myself and wrote a short description of who I am and what I do.
- The next page is my [resume](https://lehuman.github.io/COM-421-Website/html/resume.html), this is where I marked up my resume using html and css.
It also includes the download link for my resume as a PDF.
- The final page is my [contact info](https://lehuman.github.io/COM-421-Website/html/contact.html), this is where I added whatever other external links that are relevant to me.

## Future development

Because of the time constraints of this project I did not accomplish everything that I wanted todo. This includes the following.

- More consistent spacing
  - Margins and padding throughout the site are not as consistent as I hoped
- Projects page
  - The projects page would have a collage of projects that I have worked on which would linked to each individual project. Maybe also with a short description
- Links to everything relevant
  - Mostly within the resume, anything that I could href a link to I would do.
- Randomization of background images
  - The header background image could be randomly selected
- Animated transitions between pages
  - Animate the transition between pages, whether it be with the headers flying in/out the sides
- Better sizing support
  - Make the entire website react better to the viewport changing

I realize that some of these features would involve me going into scripting with JS or something similar, which I have not done.
Regardless, I hope to later on actually add these ideas onto the website in the future.
